# Lottery:

This project demonstrates a lottery system where players can enter based on a fixed fee payed in ETH. The lottery owner can chose when to close entries and a winner is randomly picked. The winner receives all the funds held in the ottery.
I have used Chainlink Oracles to get live ETH/USD data feeds and provably true randomness for the winner selection.
